**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

**Example Query:**
"What patterns do you see in financial services companies' branding challenges? I'm preparing for a pitch with a regional bank."

**Example Response:**
**Financial Services Branding Intelligence:**

**Common Challenge Patterns (based on 8 FS discovery phases):**
- **Trust vs. Innovation Tension:** 87% struggle balancing modern digital experience with traditional credibility markers
- **Regulatory Constraints:** Most cite compliance concerns as limiting creative brand expression
- **Local vs. National Perception:** Regional players want national credibility without losing community connection

**Successful Positioning Strategies:**
- **"Community-First Innovation"** (Project Alpha Bank): Increased consideration by 34%
- **"Secure Progress"** messaging (Regional Credit Union): Improved trust scores while modernizing
- **Local Heritage + Digital Future** (Community Bank): Successful merger messaging

**Competitive Landscape Insights:**
- 70% of FS brands use similar "trust" messaging (opportunity to differentiate)
- Most competitors focus on features vs. customer outcomes
- Digital-first positioning often sacrifices credibility in this sector

**Recommended Approach for Regional Bank:**
- Lead with community impact stories + innovation capability
- Address regulatory confidence upfront
- Position as "locally-rooted, digitally-enabled"
- Use case studies from [Project X] showing compliance + creativity balance
