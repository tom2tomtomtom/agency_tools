**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

**Example Input (from creative asset and brief):**
"Review this social media ad for the 'Green Roots Banking' campaign. Brief states: Target environmentally conscious millennials, tone optimistic and empowering. Ad copy: 'Bank Green, Live Free!' Visual: Stock photo of a single leaf."

**Example Output (AI-generated review snippet):**
**Creative Review: Social Media Ad - 'Green Roots Banking'**

**Alignment with Brief:**
- **Target Audience:** Partially aligned. The message is concise, but the visual might not resonate strongly with millennials seeking empowerment.
- **Tone:** "Live Free!" aligns with empowering, but "Bank Green" could be more optimistic and less directive.

**Optimization Recommendations:**
- **Visual:** Replace the generic leaf with a more dynamic and engaging visual that conveys growth, community, or positive environmental impact (e.g., a diverse group of young people planting trees, a vibrant urban garden).
- **Copy:** Refine "Bank Green" to be more active and benefit-oriented. Consider: "Grow Your Impact. Bank with Green Roots." or "Your Values, Your Bank. Start Growing Green Today!"
- **Call to Action:** Ensure a clear, compelling call to action is present and prominent.

**Overall:** The ad has potential but can be significantly strengthened by a more impactful visual and refined copy that better embodies the optimistic and empowering tone for the target audience.
