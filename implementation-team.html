**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

**Example Input (from project deliverable and quality standards):**
"Deliverable: Website Homepage Mockup. Quality Standard: All brand guidelines adhered to, mobile-responsive, clear CTA, loads in <2s. Issue: CTA button is not prominent on mobile. Generate a QA report for this."

**Example Output (AI-generated QA report snippet):**
**QA Report: Website Homepage Mockup**

**Area: Call to Action (CTA)**
- **Finding:** The primary CTA button, while present, lacks prominence on mobile viewports. It blends with the background and is not immediately clickable, potentially impacting conversion rates.
- **Severity:** Medium (Usability/Conversion Impact)
- **Recommendation:**
  - Increase button size and contrast on mobile.
  - Consider a sticky CTA for mobile view.
  - Ensure sufficient padding around the button for easy tapping.
- **Acceptance Criteria Met:** Partially (Clear CTA - No, Prominent CTA - No)

**Overall Status:** Requires revision to meet mobile responsiveness and CTA prominence standards.

**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

**Example Input (from process description):**
"Current Client Onboarding Process: Sales closes deal -> Account Manager (AM) collects client info -> AM manually enters data into CRM -> AM creates project folder -> AM schedules kickoff meeting. Bottleneck: Manual data entry is slow and error-prone. Generate a process optimization report for this."

**Example Output (AI-generated optimized process snippet):**
**Optimized Client Onboarding Process:**

**Step 1: Deal Closure & Automated Data Transfer**
- **Action:** Sales closes deal in CRM.
- **Improvement:** Automated script transfers essential client information from sales CRM to project management CRM, eliminating manual entry.
- **Benefit:** Reduces data entry time by 80%, minimizes errors.

**Step 2: Account Manager (AM) Review & Project Setup**
- **Action:** AM reviews auto-populated client data in project CRM.
- **Improvement:** System automatically creates a standardized project folder structure upon data transfer.
- **Benefit:** Ensures consistency, saves AM time on setup.

**Step 3: Automated Kickoff Meeting Scheduling**
- **Action:** AM confirms client availability.
- **Improvement:** Automated tool (e.g., Calendly integrated with CRM) sends pre-populated meeting invites to client and internal team based on project type.
- **Benefit:** Streamlines scheduling, reduces back-and-forth communication.

**Metrics to Track:**
- Time from deal close to project kickoff.
- Data entry error rate.
- AM time spent on administrative tasks.
