**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

**Example Input (from marketing collateral):**
"Review this brochure and our recent social media posts. Brand guidelines state: 'Use empowering language, avoid jargon.' Brochure uses 'synergistic solutions'. Social media post uses 'disrupting the paradigm'."

**Example Output (AI-generated communication audit snippet):**
**Communication Audit: Brochure & Social Media Posts**

**Finding 1: Jargon Usage (Brochure)**
- **Issue:** The phrase "synergistic solutions" in the brochure contradicts the brand guideline to "avoid jargon." This can alienate the target audience and reduce clarity.
- **Recommendation:** Replace with simpler, more direct language such as "collaborative solutions" or "integrated approaches that work together."

**Finding 2: Tone Inconsistency (Social Media Post)**
- **Issue:** The phrase "disrupting the paradigm" in the social media post, while impactful, may not fully align with the "empowering language" guideline if it comes across as overly aggressive or exclusive.
- **Recommendation:** Rephrase to emphasize empowerment and positive change, e.g., "Empowering change in the industry" or "Leading the way with innovative thinking."

**Overall Recommendation:** Ensure all content creators are familiar with the updated brand voice and tone guidelines, particularly regarding jargon and empowering language. Conduct a brief training session focusing on practical examples of what to avoid and what to embrace.
