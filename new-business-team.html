**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

**Example Query:**
"What insights do we have about tourism destinations looking to increase visitation from younger demographics? I'm preparing for a pitch with a regional tourism board similar to TEQ."

**Example Response Format:**
**Key Insights for Tourism Destination Youth Targeting:**
- **Primary Challenge:** Based on TEQ campaigns and regional destination work, tourism boards struggle with balancing authentic local culture with Instagram-worthy experiences
- **Successful Positioning:** TEQ's "Beautiful One Day, Perfect the Next" evolution shows emphasis on "authentic adventure" resonated better than generic destination messaging
- **Buyer Concerns:** Tourism executives prioritize measurable visitor growth and spend per visitor over pure awareness metrics
- **Recommended Framework:** Use Alt/Shift's "Identify → Investigate → Ignite" methodology from TEQ project which increased youth visitation by 35%

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Most destinations over-emphasize scenic beauty vs. experiential opportunities
- Opportunity to differentiate through adventure-focused, sustainable tourism messaging
