            <h2>Getting Started: Your First Claude Project (for Complete Beginners)</h2>
            <p>If you've never created a Claude project before, hereâ€™s a simple step-by-step guide:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Log into Claude</li>
                <li>Create a New Project</li>
                <li>Upload Your Knowledge</li>
                <li>Paste the Prompt</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Step 1: Log into Claude</strong></p>
            <p>Go to claude.ai and log in with your company account.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2: Create a New Project</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the left sidebar, click on "Projects"</li>
                <li>Click the "Create Project" button (usually blue)</li>
                <li>Name your project based on the solution you're implementing (e.g., "Executive Team - Meeting Documentation")</li>
            </ol>
            <p>ðŸ“¸ What you should see: A new, empty project with a chat interface.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3: Upload Your Knowledge</strong></p>
            <p>This is the most important step for getting high-quality results. Before you paste the prompt, you need to give Claude some context.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Look for the paperclip icon (ðŸ“Ž) or an "Upload" button in your project.</li>
                <li>Gather the recommended knowledge files for your chosen solution (see specific examples below).</li>
                <li>Upload the files by dragging and dropping or browsing your computer.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>ðŸ’¡ How much knowledge should you upload?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with 3-5 recent examples of your work in this area.</li>
                <li>Aim for a variety of documents - reports, emails, presentations, etc.</li>
                <li>Keep it under 10MB per file for best performance.</li>
                <li>You can always add more later to improve your AI assistant.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Step 4: Paste the Prompt</strong></p>
            <p>Now you're ready to set up your AI assistant.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find the solution prompt in this guide.</li>
                <li>Copy the entire prompt (the text inside the ``` block).</li>
                <li>Go to your Claude project and find the message box at the bottom.</li>
                <li>This is where you paste the prompt.</li>
                <li>Press Enter to send the prompt and set up your AI assistant.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>âœ… Success indicator: Claude should respond with something like "I understand. I'm ready to help with..."</p>
            <p>Now you can start using your AI assistant for your specific tasks!</p>

        <section id="getting-started-custom-gpt">
            <h2>Getting Started: Setting up a Custom GPT in ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>Setting up a custom GPT in ChatGPT allows you to tailor the AI for specific tasks, topics, or behaviors without needing to code. This feature is available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Enterprise users.</p>
            <h3>1. Access the GPT Builder:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Log in to your ChatGPT account.</li>
                <li>In the sidebar, click on "Explore GPTs" or navigate directly to <code>chatgpt.com/gpts</code> or <code>chatgpt.com/gpts/editor</code>.</li>
                <li>Click the "+ Create" button, usually found in the top right corner or within the "My GPTs" section.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Choose Your Creation Method (Configure Tab Recommended):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You'll see two tabs: "Create" and "Configure."</li>
                <li>The "Create" tab offers an interactive AI assistant to help build your GPT through conversation. While it can be used for quick setups, it's often recommended to use the "Configure" tab for more precise control over instructions and settings.</li>
                <li>For detailed customization, switch to the "Configure" tab.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Basic GPT Setup (Configure Tab):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name:</strong> Give your GPT a clear and memorable name (limited to 50 characters). This name will appear in the sidebar of your main chat screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> Write a brief description of what your GPT does.</li>
                <li><strong>Instructions:</strong> This is the most crucial part. Provide detailed guidelines on how the GPT should behave, its functionalities, and any behaviors to avoid. You can use Markdown for better organization and highlight critical rules in ALL CAPS (e.g., "ALWAYS use markdown when formatting output").
                    <ul>
                        <li>Define its identity and goal (e.g., "You are an expert programmer whose goal is to help users write efficient and error-free code").</li>
                        <li>Set rules for interaction, such as when to use knowledge files or how to interpret commands.</li>
                        <li>Avoid putting side effects directly in the instructions; focus on behavior.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. Add Advanced Customizations (Configure Tab):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Profile Picture:</strong> Upload an image or ask the GPT Builder to generate one for your GPT's icon.</li>
                <li><strong>Conversation Starters:</strong> Provide example prompts to help users begin a conversation with your GPT.</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Upload files (e.g., PDFs, documents) to provide additional context or specific data for your GPT to reference. This is useful for content exceeding ~8,000 characters.</li>
                <li><strong>Capabilities:</strong> Enable or disable features like Web Browsing, DALLÂ·E 3 (image generation), and Code Interpreter based on your GPT's purpose. Web browsing is off by default and must be manually enabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Actions:</strong> For advanced users, you can set up custom actions to allow your GPT to interact with external services via APIs (e.g., fetching real-time information, integrating with other software).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>5. Test and Refine:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the "Preview" panel on the right-hand side of the screen to interact with and test your GPT as you build it.</li>
                <li>Refine the instructions and settings based on the GPT's responses to improve accuracy and relevance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>6. Publish Your GPT:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Once you are satisfied with your GPT's setup, click the "Publish" or "Update" button.</li>
                <li>You can choose who to share your GPT with (e.g., "Only me," "Anyone with a link," or "Public").</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>7. Manage Your GPTs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>After creation, you can manage your GPTs from the "My GPTs" section, including options to copy links, view version history, duplicate, or delete them.</li>
                <li>Regularly update your GPT with new information and adjust its settings to adapt to changing needs.</li>
            </ul>
