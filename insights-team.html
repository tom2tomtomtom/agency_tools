ðŸ’» Example Python Code Structure:

Python


import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Data loading and cleaning
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
# Analysis code will be generated here
# Visualization code will be generated here

---
**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

**Example Input (from user):**
"Analyze the attached CSV file 'sales_data.csv'. It contains columns: 'Date', 'Region', 'Product', 'Revenue'. Calculate total revenue per region and visualize it using a bar chart. Also, identify the top 3 products by revenue."

**Example Output (AI-generated Python code and summary):**
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Calculate total revenue per region
revenue_by_region = df.groupby('Region')['Revenue'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)

# Visualize total revenue per region
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x=revenue_by_region.index, y=revenue_by_region.values, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Total Revenue per Region')
plt.xlabel('Region')
plt.ylabel('Total Revenue')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Identify top 3 products by revenue
revenue_by_product = df.groupby('Product')['Revenue'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
top_3_products = revenue_by_product.head(3)

print("
Top 3 Products by Revenue:")
print(top_3_products)
```

**Executive Summary:**
- The analysis shows the total revenue generated by each region, visualized in a bar chart.
- The top 3 products by revenue have been identified as:
  - Product A: $X,XXX
  - Product B: $Y,YYY
  - Product C: $Z,ZZZ
- Further analysis could explore revenue trends over time or customer segments within each region.

**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

**Example Input (from KPI dashboard):**
"KPI: Website Conversion Rate. Target: 3%. Current: 2.5%. Trend: Decreasing over last 3 months. Industry Benchmark: 3.5%."

**Example Output (AI-generated performance analysis snippet):**
**Performance Analysis: Website Conversion Rate**

**Current Status:** Our website conversion rate is 2.5%, falling below our target of 3% and the industry benchmark of 3.5%.

**Trend Identification:** The conversion rate has shown a consistent downward trend over the past three months, indicating a potential systemic issue rather than a temporary fluctuation.

**Potential Drivers (requires further investigation):**
- Recent website changes or updates.
- Changes in marketing campaigns or traffic sources.
- User experience issues on key landing pages.
- Increased competition or market shifts.

**Optimization Recommendations:**
1.  **Conduct A/B Testing:** Test different headlines, calls-to-action, and page layouts on high-traffic landing pages.
2.  **Review User Journey:** Analyze user behavior data (e.g., heatmaps, session recordings) to identify friction points in the conversion funnel.
3.  **Content Optimization:** Ensure website content is highly relevant and persuasive to the target audience.
4.  **Traffic Source Analysis:** Evaluate the quality of incoming traffic from various marketing channels.

**Action Plan:** Prioritize A/B testing and user journey review for immediate impact. Assign a cross-functional team to investigate potential drivers.

**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

**Example Input (from website analytics):**
"User Path: Homepage -> Product A Page -> Add to Cart -> Abandoned Cart. Data shows high bounce rate on Product A Page. Customer Segment: First-time visitors. Goal: Reduce abandoned carts."

**Example Output (AI-generated behavior analysis snippet):**
**Customer Behavior Analysis: Abandoned Cart on Product A**

**Behavior Pattern:** First-time visitors frequently add Product A to their cart but then abandon the purchase. A high bounce rate on the Product A page suggests an issue early in the conversion funnel.

**Customer Insights:**
- First-time visitors are interested enough to add to cart, indicating product appeal.
- The high bounce rate on the product page suggests potential issues with information clarity, pricing transparency, shipping costs, or a lack of trust signals for new users.

**Optimization Recommendations:**
1.  **Product Page Optimization:**
    - **Clarity:** Ensure all product details, benefits, and FAQs are easily accessible.
    - **Trust Signals:** Add customer reviews, security badges, and clear return policies.
    - **Pricing Transparency:** Clearly display total cost including shipping early in the process.
2.  **Targeted Exit-Intent Pop-ups:** Offer a small discount or free shipping to first-time visitors attempting to leave the Product A page or abandoned cart.
3.  **Personalized Follow-up Emails:** Send automated emails to users who abandoned carts, reminding them of their items and potentially offering an incentive.

**Engagement Strategy:** Focus on building trust and providing immediate value to first-time visitors on the Product A page to reduce bounce rates and improve conversion.
