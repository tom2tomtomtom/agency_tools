**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

**Example Input (from creative asset and brief):**
"Review this social media ad for the 'Work Forward, Think Green' Officeworks sustainability campaign. Brief states: Target small business owners, tone practical and empowering. Ad copy: 'Go Green at Work!' Visual: Generic office supplies on a white background."

**Example Output (AI-generated review snippet):**
**Creative Review: Social Media Ad - 'Work Forward, Think Green' Officeworks**

**Alignment with Brief:**
- **Target Audience:** Partially aligned. The message is direct, but generic office supplies don't speak to small business owners' practical needs and sustainability aspirations.
- **Tone:** "Go Green at Work" is straightforward but lacks the empowering, practical tone that resonates with busy entrepreneurs.

**Optimization Recommendations:**
- **Visual:** Replace generic supplies with a real small business workspace showcasing sustainable solutions in action - recycled paper being used for important documents, plants thriving alongside productivity tools, demonstrating practical sustainability.
- **Copy:** Refine "Go Green at Work" to be more benefit-focused and practical. Consider: "Sustainable Solutions That Work as Hard as You Do" or "Work Forward, Think Green - Where productivity meets purpose."
- **Call to Action:** Add clear next steps: "Shop Sustainable Solutions" or "Discover Your Green Office Upgrade"

**Overall:** The ad has solid foundation but needs more authentic, practical visual storytelling and empowering copy that speaks to small business owners' dual priorities of efficiency and sustainability.
